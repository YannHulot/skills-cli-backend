# Yann Hulot's Personal Site

Hey there! This is a v1 of my personal website. I wanted to see what could be done in terms of animations by using Framer motion and come up with an original design to cater to my needs while displaying my skills.

This repository is written in Typescript using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), as a SSG tool.
It utilizes [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as well as [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations.

The site is currently deployed on <b>Vercel</b>'s free tier.

## Local Development

This is just a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Please use at least Node v12, but the recommended version is Node v14 LTS. There's a `.nvmrc`, you can run `nvm use` if you have nvm installed.

## Getting Started

This project heavily favors <b>npm</b> over yarn.

So to set things up you need to run:

```bash
npm install
```

Then to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

and navigate to:

> <http://localhost:3000/>

## Deployment

Nothing special, its setup to be deployed automatically on Vercel, just merge a feature branch into main branch and you're good.
